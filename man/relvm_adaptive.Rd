\usage{
relvm_adaptive(object, groups = NULL, fit = list(qpoints = 15, init = NULL,
  predict = TRUE, adaptive = c("ad", "noad")))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A mstbl object.}

\item{groups}{A vector of measure group names. The default is NULL, in which
case a vector of all groups will be generated accordingly.}

\item{fit}{A list of fitting parameters. \itemize{ \item qpoints: The numbe
of the quadrature points. \item init: Initial values for mu, fl, and err
term in a list. fl is the factor loading. They will be initialized
generally if it is null. The default is a list with for all mu and one for
others. \item predict: The default is TRUE. \item adaptive: noad, no
adaptive or ad, use adaptive. }}
